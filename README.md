# mark-ring package

Inspired by the [Must Have Packages That Don't Exist thread](https://discuss.atom.io/t/must-have-packages-that-dont-exist/12665) and the [MarkAndMove ST package](https://github.com/colinta/SublimeMarkAndMove), I decided to implement an easier way to create mulitple cursors with only the keyboard.

# TODO:

[X] Create mark at cursor
    [ ] Toggle Mark won't remove mark
[X] Remove all marks
[ ] Move to next/previous mark
[X] View and move to marks in popover
[X] Create cursors at marks in buffer

Acknowledgements:

I heavily borrowed from the [atom-bookmarks](https://github.com/atom/bookmarks) package. The code in that package was instrumental getting this to work.
